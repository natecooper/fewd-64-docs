    <h3>CityPix</h3>
    <p><strong> The goal is to practice writting a full JavaScript application.</strong></p>
    <p>JavaScript is powerful: we're able to take user interaction and information and use it to update the page without requiring a refresh. This week, a new startup in your city, CitiPix, is looking to create a personalized picture app that allows users to store pictures they've taken around the world and quickly access them by typing in keywords or tags associated with each photo; they have asked for your help to start building the front-end prototype. You will begin by building a web-app that will take a user's input and update the background image of the page based on that input. Once again, you have been given the starter code that includes the HTML and the CSS. Use the images in the images folder and write JavaScript to make the background image reflect user input based on the Technical Requirements below.

</p>
<p><strong>Break it down:</strong></p>
<p><em>Use these tips to help you along your way</em></p>
<ul>
    <li>Write pseudocode before coding to demonstrate understanding of interactive programming theory and focus on the logic without being distracted by details of syntax</li>
    <li>Write JavaScript code that will update a web-page based on user interaction</li>
    <li>Store user-submitted information in variables to be used throughout an application</li>
    <li>Change DOM elements on the page based on user input</li>
    <li>Specify the order in which your application runs using control flow</li>
    <li>Revisit applications and code you've written to find solutions to problems you've already solved</li>
</ul>

  <h2>Technical Requirements</h2>
  <div class="info" style="text-align: left;">
    <ul>
        <li>Call $.val() on inputs to get the string value of your user's input</li>
        <li>Store user input in var city</li>
        <li>Use $.on(submit) or $.click to figure out when the user clicks the "submit" button</li>
        <li>Create if / else if / else conditionals to control the flow of your application</li>
        <li>Write at least six different lines of pseudocode and display them inline as JavaScript comments</li>
        <li>Prevent a form submission using the event.preventDefault() function</li>
        <li>Use the $.ready() handler to delay your code from executing until all DOM assets have been loaded</li>
        <li>Get the first element from an attribute name using $.attr()</li>
        <li>Use the || operator in your conditionals to allow for multiple string values to execute if/else if statement code</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If a user submits:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>"New York" or "New York City" or "NYC" make the background of the page nyc.jpg</li>
      <li>"San Francisco" or "SF" or "Bay Area" make the background of the page sf.jpg</li>
      <li>"Los Angeles" or "LA" or "LAX" make the background of the page la.jpg</li>
      <li>"Austin" or "ATX" make the background of the page austin.jpg</li>
